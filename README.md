## Corpus: Top Spotify Summer vs Winter playlists

Personally, I notice a considerable difference in type of music that I listen to in summer compared to winter. While in summer my playlists contain more upbeat, energetic and popular songs, in winter more laid-back, gloomy and unpopular music fill my playlists. 

As there is a high chance that popular music reflects people’s mood, this issue piqued my interest in how popular music during the seasons summer and winter can be compared. 

This corpus will consist of the top 5 playlists by Spotify tagged with ‘summer’ and 5 playlists with tagged with ‘winter’. Even though the playlists are made specifically for summer and winter, they do not necessarily reflect users listening behavior during these seasons, which is a constraint of this corpus.

The songs from these playlists will be compared in terms of energy, tempo, valence, dancability, language, acousticness and more. From these aspects it can be determined whether tracks in summer are indeed more upbeat, have higher tempo and energy than tracks in winter. Aspects of songs that I do not believe will differ between the two categories are for instance duration and liveness. However, danceability, energy, loudness and tempo are presumably higher for the average song in a summer playlist. I am yet unsure about aspects such as speechiness and loudness, thus very curious how these vary between the categories. 

A typical song from summer playlists is "Walking on sunshine" by Katrina & The waves, since it is energetic, happy and has a high tempo. A more atypical song currently present in winter playlists is "Head & Heart" by Joel Corry and MNEK, which probably has high scores for dancability, energy and tempo.

TLDR: Do songs in Spotify playlists specifially made for summer and winter reflect the general characteristics of people's mood in summer and winter?
